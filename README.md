This project is an initial stab at creating a software package that will leverage the Microsoft Fusion project to create a 3D image from multiple kinnects that can be exported into an STL object.  

The following are the goals that make this application a novel solution:

1) It will provide a platform for creating a 3D "snapshot" capture of a object with out the wait time of rotating an object (or rotating the kinect around the object) to create a 3D image.

2) It will increase the fidelity of the 3D scan. (using non software based solutions to overcome interference)
